      "bodyMd": "# Building Ethos: Expertise, Reliability, Benevolence\n\n## Overview\nTrust rests on three pillars: demonstrated expertise, consistent reliability, and benevolent intent. Signal each explicitly.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Expertise: relevant experience, credentials, results.\n- Reliability: follow‑through, responsiveness, accuracy.\n- Benevolence: alignment with others’ interests, not just your own.\n- Proof over claims: show, don’t tell.\n\n## Examples\n- Expertise: link to 2 case studies with metrics.\n- Reliability: clear SLAs and on‑time updates.\n- Benevolence: propose options that trade off in their favor.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Over‑claiming without evidence.\n- Promising beyond capacity, then missing commitments.\n\n## Summary\nState qualifications briefly, prove reliability with behaviors, and prioritize the audience’s goals to earn durable trust.",

Propose concrete mitigations and decision triggers to build confidence and autonomy.",

Make reliability legible and easy to verify.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Operating cadence: predictable updates and checkpoints.\n- Decisions log: record agreements and outcomes.\n- External signals: certifications, reviews, community contributions.\n- Responsiveness: SLAs for replies and actions.\n\n## Examples\n- Weekly progress notes with risks and next steps.\n- Public changelog and status page for services.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Sporadic updates that force stakeholders to chase.\n- Hiding issues until they explode.\n\n## Summary\nMake reliability observable: set cadences, keep promises, and surface evidence of consistency.",
