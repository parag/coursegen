Prioritize high‑influence stakeholders and tailor depth, framing, and cadence accordingly.",

      "bodyMd": "# Decision Criteria and Motivations\n\n## Overview\nDecisions hinge on explicit criteria and implicit motivations. Identify both to craft persuasive messages that address rational and emotional needs.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Rational criteria: ROI, compliance, feasibility, timeline.\n- Emotional drivers: status, autonomy, certainty, relatedness, fairness.\n- Jobs‑to‑be‑done (JTBD): progress the audience seeks in context.\n- Objection handling: preempt with evidence and stories.\n\n## Examples\n- Procurement: emphasize total cost of ownership, risk mitigation, references.\n- Team adoption: emphasize ease of use, reduced toil, pilot success stories.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Over‑indexing on numbers while ignoring identity/status concerns.\n- Assuming criteria are fixed; they evolve with constraints.\n\n## Summary\nWrite to the explicit checklist and the implicit motivations. Blend evidence with narrative to satisfy both.",

      "bodyMd": "# Personas, Empathy Maps, and JTBD\n\n## Overview\nPersonas and empathy maps reveal pains, gains, and contexts; JTBD clarifies the progress users seek so messages can meet them where they are.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Persona: archetype capturing goals, constraints, behaviors.\n- Empathy map: Says, Thinks, Does, Feels quadrants.\n- JTBD statement: When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].\n- Evidence base: interviews, analytics, support tickets.\n\n## Examples\n- Persona: "Ops Manager Olivia"—time‑pressed, risk‑averse, values reliability.\n- JTBD: When incidents spike, I want automated runbooks so I can restore service quickly and sleep.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Fictional personas without data.\n- One persona for all messages; instead, tailor by segment.\n\n## Summary\nGround personas and JTBD in evidence. Use empathy maps to choose language, examples, and benefits that resonate.",

Use findings to refine messages, benefits, and proofs.",

      "bodyMd": "# Objection Mapping and Evidence Strategy\n\n## Overview\nAnticipate objections and plan targeted proofs. Address rational and emotional concerns before they stall decisions.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Objection taxonomy: cost, risk, complexity, timing, identity/status.\n- Root cause: what fear or constraint underlies the objection?\n- Proof types: data, demos, pilots, references, third‑party reviews.\n- Pre‑emption: FAQ, one‑pagers, and narrative examples built into the message.\n\n## Examples\n- CFO concern: TCO and risk → reference calls + ROI model + phased rollout.\n- CTO concern: integration complexity → demo with sample data + pilot timeline.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Debating feelings with facts alone.\n- Overloading with evidence instead of the most credible 1–2 proofs.\n- Ignoring status or identity threats that block agreement.\n\n## Summary\nList objections, find root causes, and pair each with the right proof. Build answers into your narrative so objections surface and resolve early.",
