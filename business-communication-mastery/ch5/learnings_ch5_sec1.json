Align the agenda to build momentum toward the decision.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- SCQA/SCR: situation, complication, question/resolution.\n- Agenda: the path to the decision.\n- Timeboxing: allocate minutes by importance.\n\n## Examples\n- Agenda with decision points marked.\n- Slide headlines that track the arc.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Agenda as a list of topics, not outcomes.\n- Overweighting background over decisions.\n\n## Summary\nDesign a purposeful sequence that advances toward a clear decision and allocates time accordingly.",
