Counter extreme offers with justified data and multiple‑issue packages.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- First offers: set the frame but must be defensible.\n- Counter‑anchors: re‑center with objective criteria.\n- Bracketing: move toward your target in diminishing steps.\n\n## Examples\n- Respond to a lowball with a package anchored on value.\n- Reference market benchmarks and your BATNA credibly.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Accepting the other side’s anchor unchallenged.\n- Countering emotionally without data.\n\n## Summary\nUse objective criteria and packages to neutralize extreme anchors and restore a collaborative zone.",

      "bodyMd": "# Time Pressure, Deadlines, and Process Control\n\n## Overview\nDeadlines can force bad deals. Validate constraints, slow the tempo, and create options to reduce time pressure.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Verify legitimacy: real vs. artificial deadlines.\n- Tempo control: pauses, caucuses, async follow‑ups.\n- Batching issues: resolve packages, not whack‑a‑mole.\n\n## Examples\n- Ask for the rationale behind timing; propose a short extension tied to a milestone.\n- Move discussions to email to reduce heat and improve clarity.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Rushing into agreement to avoid missing a date.\n- Letting the other side dictate agenda/tempo entirely.\n\n## Summary\nRespect real constraints but protect decision quality. Control tempo and process to keep options open and thinking clear.",

Verify authority, guard against nibbling, and document terms with change controls.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Authority checks: confirm decision‑makers and approvals.\n- Anti‑nibble clauses: \"All terms resolved unless scope changes.\"\n- Change control: formalize modifications and trade‑offs.\n\n## Examples\n- Ask for the approval path and timeline explicitly.\n- Add a summary email with \"complete agreement\" language and next steps.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- \"We’ll sign, but add X and Y too\" after handshake.\n- Verbal agreements without written confirmation.\n\n## Summary\nConfirm authority, close cleanly, and require formal change control to protect the deal from entropy.",
