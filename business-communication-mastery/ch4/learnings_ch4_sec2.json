      "bodyMd": "# Packaging Offers and Contingent Agreements\n\n## Overview\nBundle issues into packages and use contingencies tied to future uncertainty to bridge gaps.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Packages: present 2–3 options with different trade profiles.\n- Contingent contracts: \"If X happens, then Y terms apply.\"\n- Objective criteria: benchmarks to resolve disagreements.\n\n## Examples\n- Performance‑based pricing tied to usage.\n- Term extensions contingent on satisfaction metrics.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Presenting a single take‑it‑or‑leave‑it offer.\n- Vague contingencies without measurement.\n\n## Summary\nOffer packages and build contingencies around uncertainties to close value gaps fairly.",

      "bodyMd": "# Concession Strategy and Pacing\n\n## Overview\nPlan concessions deliberately: each move trades for reciprocal movement and progresses toward agreement.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Concession size: decreasing over time signals a limit.\n- Reciprocity: ask for something in return.\n- Documentation: note what each concession buys.\n\n## Examples\n- Reduce price slightly for longer term and reference access.\n- Improve support hours in exchange for scope freeze.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Matching every demand tit‑for‑tat.\n- Large early concessions that set bad expectations.\n\n## Summary\nConcede strategically with clear asks and a rationale. Pace moves to preserve value and momentum.",

Use neutral, joint‑problem framing to unlock solutions.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Separate people from problems.\n- Interest‑based questions: \"What outcome matters most here?\"\n- Joint brainstorming before evaluation.\n\n## Examples\n- \"Let’s list options that reduce risk and protect budget.\"\n- \"How could we structure this to meet your timeline?\"\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Positional language that signals win/lose.\n- Prematurely rejecting ideas without exploration.\n\n## Summary\nSpeak to shared goals and explore options together before narrowing.
