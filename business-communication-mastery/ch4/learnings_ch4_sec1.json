Define your Best and Worst Alternatives to a Negotiated Agreement.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Interests vs. positions: needs vs. proposals.\n- BATNA/WATNA: fallback and worst‑case plans.\n- ZOPA: zone of possible agreement where deals can land.\n\n## Examples\n- Position: 12‑month contract. Interest: predictable costs and support.\n- BATNA: month‑to‑month with fewer features.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Entering talks without a credible BATNA.\n- Arguing positions instead of exploring interests.\n\n## Summary\nList interests on both sides. Strengthen your BATNA and estimate theirs to find leverage and realistic targets.",

      "bodyMd": "# Issue Mapping and Scoring\n\n## Overview\nMap all negotiable issues and assign scores to evaluate packages across multiple dimensions.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Issue list: price, term, scope, risk, timeline, service levels.\n- Scoring: weight issues; convert into comparable points.\n- Trade‑offs: give on low‑value to gain on high‑value issues.\n\n## Examples\n- 100‑point model: price 40, term 20, scope 20, support 20.\n- Compare packages by total score, not just price.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Negotiating one issue at a time.\n- Vague terms that resist scoring.\n\n## Summary\nScore multi‑issue packages to evaluate value holistically. Use the model to guide trades and proposals.",

      "bodyMd": "# Reservation Price and Targets\n\n## Overview\nDefine your reservation point (walk‑away) and your aspirational target before talks begin.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Reservation price: point at which you prefer your BATNA.\n- Target: ambitious but realistic outcome.\n- Bracketing: set asks to anchor above target while credible.\n\n## Examples\n- Price band: reserve at $X, target at $Y, open at $Y+Δ.\n- Non‑price terms: reserve on liability caps or response times.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- No pre‑defined walk‑away.\n- Targets set by wish, not market and BATNA.\n\n## Summary\nWrite down your reservation and target points. Use them to resist pressure and structure proposals.",

Iterate based on gaps exposed in role‑plays.",
