      "bodyMd": "# Directness, Power Distance, and Context\n\n## Overview\nCultural norms vary in directness, hierarchy, and reliance on shared context. Adapt your style to reduce friction.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Low vs. high context communication.\n- Power distance: deference and decision patterns.\n- Direct vs. indirect feedback norms.\n\n## Examples\n- In high‑context settings, provide more backstory and read implicit cues.\n- In low‑context, get to the point and request explicit decisions.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Reading indirectness as evasiveness.\n- Mistaking deference for agreement.\n\n## Summary\nObserve and adapt to context and hierarchy norms. Make your intent explicit and verify understanding across styles.",

Add buffers and explicit definitions to reduce missed expectations.",
