Choose the right type (decision, alignment, brainstorm, 1:1) or an async alternative.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Goal clarity and pre‑reads.\n- Agenda with timeboxes and roles.\n- Async alternatives: docs, Looms, polls.\n\n## Examples\n- Convert status meetings into async updates.\n- Keep decision meetings small and prepared.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Meetings without a defined outcome.\n- Inviting spectators who don’t contribute.\n\n## Summary\nMeet only when necessary, with clear goals and the right people. Default to async updates for information sharing.",
