Keep each part crisp and linked to a concrete decision.",

Connect the transformation to the decision you seek.",

Headline every slide with the takeaway that advances the decision.",

Iterate quickly to align on structure.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Sticky‑note beats: arrange key points physically or digitally.\n- Constraints: time/slide limits force prioritization.\n- Feedback early: validate flow before detail.\n\n## Examples\n- 8‑slide storyboard with headlines only for review.\n- Doc outline with section headings and bullets first.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Overwriting before the structure is right.\n- Adding detail that later gets cut.\n\n## Summary\nLock the structure using storyboards/outlines.
