Use breathing, labeling, and timeouts to de‑escalate.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Physiological down‑regulation: breath, posture, pacing.\n- Affect labeling: \"I’m noticing I’m getting defensive.\"\n- Timeout and reset: take short breaks.\n\n## Examples\n- 4‑7‑8 breathing before responding.\n- \"Let’s pause for five minutes and reconvene.\"\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Reacting from threat response.\n- Plowing ahead when flooded.\n\n## Summary\nStabilize physiology and name emotions to regain cognitive control and reduce heat in the room.",
