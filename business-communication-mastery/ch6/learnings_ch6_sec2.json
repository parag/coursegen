Return to observable data and test interpretations together.",

Could we confirm changes 24h ahead? (R)\"\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Using NVC formula mechanically.\n- Turning requests into demands.\n\n## Summary\nUse NVC to reduce defensiveness and surface needs. Keep language natural and focused on solutions.",

Define when and how to escalate if commitments slip.",
